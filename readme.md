Choose random phone numbers, get responses,
and then choose better ones, optimizing for
response rate.

We make a table that looks like this.

    country,d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,d9,d10,response
    01,     1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6,  FALSE
    01,     1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 8, 4, 2,  TRUE

Then we build a decision tree. Here are some
methods we might use.
